* [Instructions](#instructions)
* [Get Started](#get-started)

## Instructions

Find the file `index.js` and complete tasks 1, 2 and 3 until all of your tests pass.
There is an additional task 4 which requires written explanations and has no tests.

If you run into trouble while coding, fight the good fight for 20 minutes and then get on the help channel. __Remember to formulate your help request in a professional manner__ - like you would at work - by including error messages, screenshots, and any other pertinent information about the problem, as well as what kinds of things you tried already while attempting to solve it.

## Get Started

Two options are included below.

  1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`.
  1. Install dependencies using npm.
  1. Run the test:watch command.
  1. Work on your branch, push commits and create PR as usual.
